# As an API

In some cases, it's simply more elegant to send and receive the data from an API. This way, you don't have to worry about installing dependendies, etc.

We have created a very light API that will allow you to send `POST` requests and receive `json`. Just make sure to send your data in the proper format.
```
{
 "data": {...}
 "method": "pxf2bff"
}
```

Please see more instructions at this [README](https://github.com/mrueda/Convert-Pheno/tree/main/api).
