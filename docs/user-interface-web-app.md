We have created a user-friendly **web application** that simplifies the process of data conversion, eliminating the need for command-line usage. The application comes with a search function and displays the data as HTML tables, and users can download their data as well.

!!! Hint "UI Web App playground"
    We have developed a **secure testing environment**, or playground, for the app. This environment allows users to test the app using synthetic data as well as upload their own data.
