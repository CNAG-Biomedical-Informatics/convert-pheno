# Command-line tool

Inspired by `convert` tool from [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/script/convert.php) and from [OpenBabel](https://openbabel.org/wiki/Main_Page), `Convert-Pheno` can work as a command-line tool.

The operation is simple:

    $ convert-pheno -input-format <filein> -output-format <fileout>

Using it as a command line tools works well when your input are **text files**, for instance, coming from an PostgreSQL export or dump.

Please see more examples in this [README](https://github.com/mrueda/convert-pheno#synopsis).
